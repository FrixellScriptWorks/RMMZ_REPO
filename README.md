# RMMZ_REPO

Welcome to my RPG Maker MZ Repository. Here you can look at my simple works. What? Yes. I'm new in JavaScript so I need more time to learn and adapt so I can contribute to RPG Maker Community.

## Purpose

While I am exploring and learning this new language, I want to made a plugins that simple, and independent. Independent by means it doesn't need any 'core' plugins to works.
I make it like that so I can use plugins more freely and avoid conflict with each other which make my plugins raise a war flag.

## Disclaimer

I maybe take a reference from any other plugins, but I am not plagiating it.
But the 'help' format I largely using VisuStella theme. I need to rework that.
By the way, VisuStella plugins cannot be looked. It has been encrypted so I can only look at their help section (which they also included in ther website).

## Terms of Use

My plugins are tottaly free. But you must credits me when distributing. [See More](https://github.com/FrixellScriptWorks/RMMZ_REPO/blob/main/LICENSE)

Be careful, if some of my plugins has dependencies, you must direct to their terms of use too.
